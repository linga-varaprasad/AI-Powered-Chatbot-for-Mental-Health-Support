# üè• Healthcare Support Chatbot

A healthcare support chatbot that provides empathetic and informative responses to user queries about health and well-being. This chatbot is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **Groq** AI for generating responses. It includes features like data encryption, anonymous usage, and real-time user interaction.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Healthcare Responses**: Uses Groq's LLaMA model to generate responses based on user input.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, providing a simple and clean interface for user queries.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements exponential backoff using the `tenacity` library to handle errors and API failures.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensures that conversations are not stored and uses secure communication protocols (SSL/TLS).
- **Additional Features**: Includes health tips, emergency contacts, and session reset options.
